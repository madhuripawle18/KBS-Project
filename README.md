# ABOUT THE DATASET

NOAAâ€™s Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) is an integrated database of climate summaries from land surface stations across the globe that have been subjected to a common suite of quality assurance reviews. The data are obtained from more than 20 sources. Two GHCN datasets are available in BigQuery, the GHCN-D (daily) and the GHCN-M (monthly).

The GHCN-Daily is an integrated database of daily climate summaries from land surface stations across the globe, and is comprised of daily climate records from over 100,000 stations in 180 countries and territories, and includes some data from every year since 1763.

# SOURCE & DOMAIN

The source of the data is National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
This dataset belongs to various domains - Climate, Financial Services and Science & Research.

# TARGET AUDIENCE

The target audience would be the general public of the respective areas and would help them to tackle the problems related to the domains. For example, climate dataset and predictions on that will help areas which don't have proper access to remote surveillance. 

# PREPROCESSING

The data cleaning steps that we are going to follow are :
* Handle NULL values
* Make sure the datatypes are same
* Handle duplicate data
* Handle missing data

# TENTATIVE PLAN

* EDA and Preprocessing
* Dashboard for User group, Dashboard for Data Engineers
* GCP further processing - ML
* Evaluation of results
* Steps for production model
* Final Dashboard for User Group
